Here is a normal Singleton implementation

https://github.com/NiCHUY/Patterns/blob/master/src/Singleton/Singleton.java

Singleton is a generative pattern that guarantees the existence of only one object of a certain class, and also allows
you to reach this object from anywhere in the program.

Applicability: Singleton is considered as antipattern by many programmers, so it is becoming less and less common in
Java code.

Signs of the pattern being used: Singleton can be identified by a static creation method that returns the same object.
